# Airline-reservations-system-Database (PL language version)

The project was a part of Database management system course at UTP and touched upon Airline reservations system. 
The project consisted of three major points: 
Firstly, designing 3 Entity-Relationship diagrams (in UML, Chen and Barker), which were logical diagrams representing relationships 
between entities. 
Secondly, building database in Firebird server based on diagrams. Firebird is an open-source SQL relational database management system. 
Thirdly, running series of SQL statements to select data from database and checking the integrity at the same time.
